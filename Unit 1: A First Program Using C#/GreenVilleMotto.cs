The case problems in this section introduce two fictional businesses. 
You will create increasingly complex classes for these businesses that use the newest concepts you have mastered in each chapter.

Instructions
Greenville County hosts the Greenville Idol competition each summer during the county fair. 
The talent competition takes place over a three-day period during which contestants are eliminated 
following rounds of performances until the year’s ultimate winner is chosen.

Write a program named GreenvilleMotto that displays the competition’s motto, which is “The stars shine in Greenville.” 
Edit the program so that it displays the motto surrounded by a border composed of asterisks.

Your output should look like the following:
************************************
*  The stars shine in Greenville.  *
************************************
*/

using static System.Console;
class GreenvilleMotto
{
   static void Main()
   {
    // Display the Greenville motto
    WriteLine("************************************");
    WriteLine("*  The stars shine in Greenville.  *");
    WriteLine("************************************");
   }
}
