The case problems in this section introduce two fictional businesses. 
You will create increasingly complex classes for these businesses that use the newest concepts you have mastered in each chapter.

Instructions
Marshall’s Murals is a company that paints interior and exterior murals for both business and residential customers.

Write a program named MarshallsMotto that displays the company motto, which is “Make your vision your view.” 
Edit the program so that it displays the motto surrounded by a border composed of repeated M s.

Your output should like the following:

MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
M  Make your vision your view.  M
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
*/

using static System.Console;
class MarshallsMotto
{
   static void Main()
   {
    // Display Marshalls motto
    WriteLine("MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM");
    WriteLine("M  Make your vision your view.  M");
    WriteLine("MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM");
