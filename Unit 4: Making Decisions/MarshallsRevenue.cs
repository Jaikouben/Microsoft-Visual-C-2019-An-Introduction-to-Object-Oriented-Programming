/*
In Chapter 2, you created an interactive application named MarshallsRevenue. The program prompts a user for the number of interior and exterior murals scheduled to be painted during the next month by Marshallâ€™s Murals.

Next, the programs compute the expected revenue for each type of mural when interior murals cost $500 each and exterior murals cost $750 each. The application also displays the total expected revenue and a statement that indicates whether more interior murals are scheduled than exterior ones.

Using the program you wrote in Case Study 2 of Chapter 2, modify the application to accept a numeric value for the month being scheduled and to modify the pricing as follows:
  Because of uncertain weather conditions, exterior murals cannot be painted in December through February, so change the number of exterior murals to 0 for those months.
  Marshall prefers to paint exterior murals in April, May, September, and October. To encourage business, he charges only $699 for an exterior mural during those months. Murals in other months continue to cost $750.
  Marshall prefers to paint interior murals in July and August, so he charges only $450 for an interior mural during those months. Murals in other months continue to cost $500.

The three different examples of the program are shown below:
  // 1
  Enter the month >> 1
  Enter number of interior murals scheduled >> 2
  Enter number of exterior murals scheduled >> 3
  2 interior murals are scheduled for a total of $1,000.00
  0 exterior murals are scheduled for a total of $0.00
  Total revenue expected is $1,000.00
  It is True that there are more interior murals scheduled than exterior ones.

  // 2
  Enter the month >> 5
  Enter number of interior murals scheduled >> 1
  Enter number of exterior murals scheduled >> 2
  1 interior murals are scheduled for a total of $500.00
  2 exterior murals are scheduled for a total of $1,398.00
  Total revenue expected is $1,898.00
  It is False that there are more interior murals scheduled than exterior ones.

  // 3
  Enter the month >> 8
  Enter number of interior murals scheduled >> 2
  Enter number of exterior murals scheduled >> 1
  2 interior murals are scheduled for a total of $900.00
  1 exterior murals are scheduled for a total of $750.00
  Total revenue expected is $1,650.00
  It is True that there are more interior murals scheduled than exterior ones.
