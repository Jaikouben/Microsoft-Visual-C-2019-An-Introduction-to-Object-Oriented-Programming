/*
In Chapter 1, you created two programs to display the motto for Marshallâ€™s Murals.

Now write a program named MarshallsRevenue that prompts a user for the number of interior and exterior murals scheduled to be painted during the next month.

Compute the expected revenue for each type of mural. Interior murals cost $500 each, and exterior murals cost $750 each.

Also display the total expected revenue and a statement that indicates whether more interior murals are scheduled than exterior ones.

An example of the program is shown below:
  Enter number of interior murals scheduled >> 3
  Enter number of exterior murals scheduled >> 1
  3 interior murals are scheduled at $500.00 each for a total of $1,500.00
  1 exterior murals are scheduled at $750.00 each for a total of $750.00
  Total revenue expected is $2,250.00
  It is True that there are more interior murals scheduled than exterior ones.
